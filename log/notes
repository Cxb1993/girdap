@11-20-2015: EU : Internal corner cells are not yet supported (see Vertex.cpp)
                  Boundary cells are defined for only quad in Vertex.cpp
                  -- This can be extended through a new virtual function (in Cells)
@2-2-2016: EU : * Grid coarsening algorithm with master cell approach is 
                  working with some exceptions (needs to be investigated)
                * Level set (vortex stretching) is now producing better results
