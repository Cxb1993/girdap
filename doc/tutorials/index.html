Following examples will help you start using _girdap_. Examples below should be considered as the driving code that use _girdap_ library. You can create your own ```main.cpp``` or modify one of ```main_xxx.cpp``` files which can be found in the ```src``` directory. Note that headers should be included before the main() function;

    #include <girdap_rootdir/grdap>
    #include <stdio>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // examples should be placed here
    // --> begin here
    
    // --> end here 
    exit(0); 
    }
