Many open source and commercial software allows an interface that allow the user to change parameters of a numerical algorithm. Even changing boundary conditions of a partial differential equation dynamically is almost impossible. `girdap` is a library equipped with objects and their methods to allow such a flexibility and allows the user to develop their own algorithms through not so complicated i.e. conditional statements and loops.

At this early stage of the development, girdap will remain as a library while it is envisioned to be equipped with a REPL (read-eval-print loop) type command line interpreter, similar to Matlab, for increasing productivity.
