**girdap** was founded as a strong will to have building blocks enabling multiphase flow simulations, with moving/deforming interfaces separating strongly coupled multiple-fluid flows. Even though, **girdap**'s fundamental goal is to enable research mainly on level-set and immersed boundary methods, its scope grew to include multi-physics problems as its tools are built to allow multiple volume/surface domains/grids, each of which can have any number of field variables/vectors, governed by independent set of equations with independent set of boundary conditions. 

## Typical end-user

**girdap** objects and methods can be used to devise new algorithm or variations of existing numerical algorithms in fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid-solid interaction, particle based methods etc. Please check current set of features; as well as the next release's target features if you plan to use girdap. The advantage of **girdap is related to its automated anisotropic grid refinement in quad-based meshes. We would be glad if you would like to contribute to "use of girdap" as a researcher or an educator.

## Typical contributor/developer

**girdap** project welcomes any volunteers to join the development team, for adding new features. Following is the present primary focus areas:

1. Refinement criterion: Error estimate for time dependent pde's
2. Geometric multigrid; domain decomposition; parallel computing
3. Intergrid operations; flux-conserving interpolation schemes
