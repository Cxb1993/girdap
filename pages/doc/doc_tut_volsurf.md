## Multiple grids (volume & surface)
  This example creates two grids; one formed by quads, named as `volgrid`; and the other formed by line strings, named as `surf`. `volgrid` is formed by a an automated block generation utility in 2D, called `Block2`, while `surf` is generated by manually adding vertices and cells. The output is written in VTK format to be visualized in additional software, i.e. Paraview.
  
{% highlight c++ linenos %}
 Block2* volgrid = new Block2({0,0,0}, {1,1,0}, 10, 10); 
 Grid* surf = new Grid(); 

 surf->addVertex( { {0.5,0.4}, {0.6,0.5}, {0.5,0.6}, {0.4,0.5} } ); 
 surf->addCell( { {0,1}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,0} } ); 

 volgrid->writeVTK("vol"); 
 surf->writeVTK("surf"); 

 delete(volgrid); 
 delete(surf); 
{% endhighlight %}	   

Above code produces the following result:
