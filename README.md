This project's aim is to develop object-oriented c++ libraries for solving conservation equations on a self-managed grid. 

###DISCLAIMER
This project is still in a early phase, expect to see bugs. 

###REQUIREMENTs
C++ compiler that accepts C++11 standards 

###COMPILE
use "mk" script (tested on Linux and Mac)

#PRIORITIES:
#1. Anisotropic mesh refinement for Quad/Hexa cells. 
#2. Solution based adaptation criteria. 
#3. 2nd order (or higher) Laplace operator; 
#4. 2nd order (or higher) Divergence operator;
#5. Euler and explicit RK2/RK4 time integration 
#6. Fractional step method for transient incompressible flows
 
#SECONDARY
#1. Use of laplace operator to generate body-fitted grids.
